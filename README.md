- Vue.js
- Pinia Store

- Representation of a piano keyboard
	- Flat colors minimalist design, just black and white rectangles
	- But, instead of 7/5 layout, we use 6/6 layout. Meaning each white key is followed by a black key, and vice versa, no gap. 
- The representation should adapt to its container in a responsive manner. 
- Number of octaves should be adjustable in the code
- Each key should have a property with their MIDI number equivalent
